<p>Richard is often called upon to <span>write or edit scripts</span> for projects and is keen to accept new commissions. 
</p>
<p>He is happy to <span>offer advice</span> on improving the flow of scripts submitted by clients whose first language is not English, or where the written word needs to be ‘translated’ from printed into spoken English.
</p>
<p>Please call to discuss your requirements.
